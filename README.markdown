PBGUtilities
============

This is a small collection of classes and class categories which I find useful for iOS development. I plan to grow this collection as time allows. The license is BSD, so feel free to use these in your own projects. There's an Xcode project file, but the classes are meant to be used individually. The xcodeproj is just for unit tests and to make modifications easier.

This project follows the SemVer versioning guidelines. For more information, see semver.org
